# project2_icg

Unity project where the player must collect 3 chests and kill all 3 npc's in order to win the game. The player has 3 lives before game over. Each time the player enters a house, the npc will chase them until they leave, unless they collect the treasure chest. If the player collects a treasure chest, the npc patrolling that chest will chase the player outside of the house. There are energy gems around the area that the player can collect. If a player collects 3 of these, they will be powered up for 10 seconds and can chase and kill the npc's. Alternatively, if the player collects all 3 chests they will be permenantly powered up and can chase and kill the npc's.
